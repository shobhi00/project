            <h1>Building access to crucial life saving devices</h1>
            <p>1MDM began as a concept idea in 2019 as a platform for access to medical devices & machines, the idea was to make access to information easy & all in one singular place.</p>
            <p>The initial plan began as purely a platform for listing various medical machines across the world, starting with India as the base of this information. However something unexpected struck in 2020 with a global pandemic and the project had been shelved as the focus shifted to building & focusing on existing projects.</p>
            <p>The global pandemic had taken a serious toll & had pushed the supply chain to its maximum capacity, this phase was followed by a sharp hike in prices of oxygen concentrators and people hoarding or price hiking certain critical and life saving devices during the phase. The project was an obvious solution at the time to help people who were in need of such supplies.</p>
            <p>After seeing the heavy shortage and strain on the supply chain, 1MDM was launched again but focused only on oxygen concentrators providing reliable information to those in need of such suppliers. We had made sure to provide only manufacturers that werenâ€™t taking advantage of the price hike to unfairly push such products in the market. We had begun to slowly expand the product information to include other critical & life saving devices across the sector and began offering the information from our platform as a singular source of the information.</p>
